# Tactical-Extraction-Shooter-Text
Tactical Extraciton Shooter Text (TEST) is a text-based game loosely based on modern extraction shooters.
This is a current work-in-progress with temporary placeholding names as I develop it.
There may be some things you recognize from mainstream games.
Eventually all names and direct references will be removed or changed to orignal ideas.

Repository includes all files and documentation created during development.
All game statistics and information is contained in Info.
